This folder contains three files
1. simple_char_driver.c
	this is the driver file. this has a read, write, open, close, seek, init, and exit functions.
	This file is what runs the calls
2. Makefile
	this contains one line "obj-m:=simple_char_driver.o"
	this tells the kernel to make the object file.
	I removed the hello object from the Makefile because i didnt want it there
3. simpletest.c
	this is the file that we run to test the driver. from here we can read, write, seek, and even exit
